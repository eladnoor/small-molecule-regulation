\section{Futile Cycles and Small Molecule Regulation}
We gathered information regarding reactions that are involved in futile cycling (dissipation of ATP), using the \emph{E. coli} genome scale model \textbf{iJO1366}. We mapped these reactions to enzymes, using EC number information (where available) and ended up with 75 unique reactions that take part in futile cycles (\texttt{FutileCycleReactionsECnumber.csv}). From these, using our SMRN, we find that 37 are regulated by at least one small molecule, whereas 38 are not regulated (\texttt{FutileCycleRegulatoryInfo.csv}).


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
	\hline
    & In Futile Cycle & Not in Futile Cycle  \\ \hline
Regulated by small molecule & 37 & 327  \\ \hline
Not regulated & 38 & 266 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


Using a right-tailed Fischerâ€™s exact test (fishertest function, MATLAB) to detect if there are significantly more small molecule regulation in futile cycle participating reactions, we verify that there is no significant overrepresentation of regulation in reactions that take part in futile cycling (p = 0.86).

\section{Metabolic Control Analysis}
\subsection{What is elasticity?}
Metabolic Control Analysis \cite{Fell1996-be} is a mathematical framework to understanding the dynamics and control of metabolic networks. In particular, it defines local properties called elasticities that can be used to quantify how the control of metabolic fluxes depends on other quantities in the system (\textit{i.e.} the topology of the metabolic network, and the levels of metabolites). \emph{Scaled elasticity} is defined as the infinitesimal response of a single flux ($v$) to one of the parameters ($a$), using a partial derivative of the log-scaled functions:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon_a^v \equiv \frac{\partial \ln(v)}{\partial \ln(a)} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial a} ~ \frac{a}{v}
\end{eqnarray}

The elasticity has several properties which make it desirable for modeling metabolic systems. In particular, for a variety of kinetic rate laws (\textit{e.g.} Michaelis-Menten kinetics), the elasticity (for Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the substrate elasticity is bounded between 0 and 1). 

\subsection{Single-substrate Control in Michaelis-Menten Kinetics}
To illustrate the concept of elasticity, let us consider an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, described by a one-substrate irreversible Michaelis-Menten kinetic rate law:
\begin{eqnarray}
    v &=& V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s}
\end{eqnarray}
where $s$ is the substrate concentrations (in units of molar), and $K_M$ is the Michaelis-Menten coefficient (also in molar).

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{loglogaxis}[width=200pt,axis x line=bottom, axis y line=left, tick align=outside, domain=1e-2:1e3, xlabel=$s/K_M$, ylabel=$\frac{s}{K_M + s}$]
	\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{(\x/(1+\x))});
	\end{loglogaxis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The scaled elasticity for $s$ is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon_s^v &=& \frac{\partial v}{\partial s} ~ \frac{s}{v} = V^+ ~ \frac{K_M + s - s}{(K_M + s)^2} ~ \frac{s}{v} \nonumber \\
    &=& \frac{K_M}{(K_M + s)^2} ~ (K_M + s) = \frac{K_M}{K_M + s} = 1 - \frac{s}{K_M + s}\label{eq:eps_s_v_irr}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{semilogxaxis}[width=200pt,axis x line=bottom, axis y line=left, tick align=outside, domain=1e-2:1e3, xlabel=$s/K_M$, ylabel=$\epsilon_s^v$]
	\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{(1/(1+\x))});
	\end{semilogxaxis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Note that the scaled elasticity is bounded between 0 and 1. More specifically, $\epsilon_s^v$ is maximized (\textit{i.e.} the substrate has the highest control potential) at low substrate concentrations, and minimized at high substrate concentrations.

As shown in \cite{Noor2013-vv}, this formula for substrate elasticity can be generalized to reversible Michaelis-Menten reactions, where the saturation term is separated from the thermodynamic term:
\begin{eqnarray}
    v &=& V^+ \cdot \kappa \cdot \gamma \\
    \kappa &\equiv& \frac{s/K_S}{1 + s/K_S + p/K_P} \\
    \gamma &\equiv& 1 - \frac{p/s}{K_{eq}'}
\end{eqnarray}
where $p$ is the product concentration, $K_S$ and $K_P$ are the Michaelis-Menten constants for the substrate and product, and $K_{eq}'$ is the apparent equilibrium constant. In this case, the elasticity of the substrate is:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon_s^v &=& \gamma^{-1} - \kappa
\end{eqnarray}
which converges to equation \ref{eq:eps_s_v_irr} as $p \rightarrow 0$.

\subsection{Regulatory Effectors}
Although previous publications have derived elasticities associated with small-molecule effectors for different types of rate laws \cite{Heinrich1974-yj, Liebermeister2010-vd}, the relationship between the elasticity and the relative activity of the enzyme has not been discussed. Here, we will demonstrate that in almost all cases, \emph{there is a direct trade-off between the two, namely that a regulator must decrease the activity of the enzyme in order to have a non-zero elasticity.}

Without loss of generality, we will keep the separable form of the rate law
\[v = V^+ \cdot \kappa \cdot \gamma \cdot \theta(x)\]
where we add a multiplicative term $\theta(x)$ that will represent the decrease of activity due to the small-molecule regulation ($x$). As long as $\theta(x)$ is the only term affected by $x$, i.e. $\frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial x} = 0$, the exact forms of $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ are irrelevant.

\subsubsection{Activation}
First, consider a cooperative \cite{Barcroft1910-rx, Monod1965-dq} activator with Hill coefficient $h$ and activation coefficient $K_A$:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \theta &=& \frac{a^h}{K_A^h + a^h}~.
\end{eqnarray}
The elasticity with respect to the activator concentration $x$ will thus be:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon_a^v &=& \frac{\partial v}{\partial a} ~ \frac{a}{v} = V^+ ~ \kappa ~ \gamma ~ \frac{h~a^{h-1} (K_A^h + a^h) - h~a^{h-1} a^h}{(K_A^h + a^h)^2}~\frac{a}{v} \nonumber \\
    &=& h~\frac{K_A^h}{K_A^h + a^h} = h (1 - \theta) \label{eq:eps_act}
\end{eqnarray}
\wolf{to make this even more general, we can also mention the case
	of an activator that increases an already existing activity: instead
	of $\theta$, we get $\alpha + (1-\alpha) \theta$ with a constant
	relative baseline activity $\alpha$. In this case, the elasticity
	formula remains the same, except for a constant prefactor; the same
	logic can also be applied to inhibitors.}

\subsubsection{Pure non-Competitive Inhibition}
Next, we consider a pure non-competitive inhibitor with Hill coefficient $h$ and inhibition coefficient $K_I$:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \theta &=& 1 - \frac{x^h}{K_I^h + x^h} = \frac{K_I^h}{K_I^h + x^h}
\end{eqnarray}

The following plot shows the response of $\theta$ to the concentration $x$ in log-log scale.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{loglogaxis}[width=200pt,axis x line=bottom, axis y line=left, tick align=outside, domain=1e-2:1e3, xlabel=$x/K_I$, ylabel=$\theta$ (relative activity)]
		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{(1 - (\x/(1+\x))});
		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{(1 - (\x^2/(1+\x^2))});
		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{(1 - (\x^3/(1+\x^3))});
		\end{loglogaxis}
	\node[rotate=-35] at (4.1, 3.2) {h = 1};
	\node[rotate=-55] at (4.2, 1.5) {h = 2};
	\node[rotate=-70] at (3.2, 1) {h = 3};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In this case, the elasticity with regards to the inhibitor concentration would be:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon_x^v &=& \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\cdot\frac{x}{v} = V^+ ~ \kappa ~ \gamma ~ \frac{- h ~ x^{h-1}}{(K_I^h + x^h)^2} ~ \frac{x}{v} \nonumber \\
    &=& -\frac{h ~ x^h ~ (K_I^h + x^h)}{(K_I^h + x^h)^2} = -h ~ \frac{x^h}{K_I^h + x^h} = -h (1 - \theta)~. \label{eq:eps_inh}
\end{eqnarray}

Plotting the elasticity as a function of $x$, we see that it is a monotonically decreasing negative function:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{semilogxaxis}[width=200pt,axis x line=bottom, axis y line=left, tick align=outside, domain=1e-2:1e2, xlabel=$i/K_I$, ylabel=$|\epsilon_x^v|$]
		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{1 * (\x/(1+\x))});		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{2 * (\x^2/(1+\x^2))});		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{3 * (\x^3/(1+\x^3))});
	\node[rotate=1] at (10, 0.6) {h = 1};
	\node[rotate=1] at (10, 1.7) {h = 2};
	\node[rotate=1] at (10, 2.7) {h = 3};
	\end{semilogxaxis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This means that substrates have the most control ($|\epsilon_s^v| \rightarrow 1$) when they are much below saturation ($s \ll K_M$) while inhibitors have the most control ($|\epsilon_x^v| \rightarrow h$) when they are saturated ($x \gg K_I$).


\subsubsection{Competitive Inhibition}
Competitive inhibition is one case, where a separable kinetic rate law is not sufficient since $\frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial x} \neq 0$. To analyze this case, we pick a simple one-substrate irreversible reaction, where the inhibitor affects the $K_M$ according to the following formula:
\begin{eqnarray}
    v &=& V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M \left(1 + \frac{x^h}{K_I^h}\right) + s}
\end{eqnarray}
In this case, we can define an \emph{effective} inhibition constants $K_{IC}$, that will allow us to rewrite this rate law in a form identical to non-competitive inhibition:
\begin{eqnarray}
    K_{IC} &\equiv& K_I \sqrt[h]{\frac{K_M + s}{K_M}} \nonumber\\
    v &=& V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M \left(1 + \frac{x^h}{K_I^h}\right) + s} =
          V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M \left(1 + \frac{x^h~(K_M + s)}{K_{IC}^h~K_M}\right) + s} = \nonumber\\
      &=& V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s + \frac{x^h~(K_M + s)}{K_{IC}^h}} = 
          V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x^h}{K_{IC}^h}} \label{eq:eps_comp_inh}
\end{eqnarray}
so we can see here that in this case $\theta = \frac{K_{IC}^h}{K_{IC}^h~+~x^h}$, exactly like in the case of non-competitive inhibition. Of course, the difference here is that $K_{IC}$ is not a binding constant but rather a function of $s$, $K_M$, and $K_I$. Nevertheless, we can use the same formula for the elasticity (since $K_{IC}$ is a constant with regards to $x$):
\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon_x^v &=& \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}~\frac{x}{v} = -h(1 - \theta)
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Uncompetitive Inhibition}
Uncompetitive inhibition is another case where substrate and inhibitor saturations are entangled:
\begin{eqnarray}
    v &=& V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s \left(1 + \frac{x^h}{K_I^h}\right)}
\end{eqnarray}
However, the same procedure as in competitive inhibition can also be used here, by defining an effective constant $K_{IU}$, that will allow us to rewrite this rate law in a form identical to non-competitive inhibition:
\begin{eqnarray}
    K_{IU} &\equiv& K_I \sqrt[h]{\frac{K_M + s}{s}} \nonumber\\
    v &=& V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s \left(1 + \frac{x^h}{K_I^h}\right)} =
          V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s \left(1 + \frac{x^h~(K_M + s)}{K_{IU}^h~s}\right)} = \nonumber\\
      &=& V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s + \frac{x^h~(K_M + s)}{K_{IU}^h}} = 
          V^+ ~ \frac{s}{K_M + s} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x^h}{K_{IU}^h}}
\end{eqnarray}
which shows that just like in the case of competitive inhibition, $\theta = \frac{K_{IU}^h}{K_{IU}^h~+~x^h}$, and the formula for elasticity remains
\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon_x^v = -h(1 - \theta)\,. \label{eq:eps_uncomp_inh}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Generalized Inhibition Model}
A general formula for reversible reactions with non-cooperative competitive, uncompetitive, mixed and pure non-competitive inhibition is given in Chapter 5 of \citet{Sauro2011-op}:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:gen_inh_model}
    v &=& \frac{\frac{V^+}{K_S}\left(s - \frac{p}{K_{eq}}\right)\left(1 + b \frac{x}{aK_I}\right)}{\left(1 + \frac{s}{K_S} + \frac{p}{K_P}\right) + \frac{x}{K_I} \left(1 + \frac{s}{aK_S} + \frac{p}{aK_P}\right)}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
The parameter $b$ represents the amount of inhibition, i.e. the activity of the enzyme when the inhibitor is bound to it. If we assume there is no activity in the bound state, also known as \textbf{complete inhibition}, then we can set $b = 0$. 
Then, depending on the value of $a$, the above formula converges to the different cases discussed earlier. For example, if $a \rightarrow \infty$, then this rate law is equivalent to competitive inhibition. When $a = 1$ it is equivalent to pure non-competitive inhibition. Finally, if $a \rightarrow 0$ (more precisely, when $K_I \gg a K_I$), it becomes uncompetitive inhibition.

The elasticity we get for this general form is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_x^v &=& \frac{b \frac{x}{aK_I}}{1 + b \frac{x}{aK_I}} ~-~ \frac{\frac{x}{K_I} \left(1 + \frac{s}{aK_S} + \frac{p}{aK_P}\right)}{\left(1 + \frac{s}{K_S} + \frac{p}{K_P}\right) + \frac{x}{K_I} \left(1 + \frac{s}{aK_S} + \frac{p}{aK_P}\right)}
\end{eqnarray}
as with previous cases, we can define an effective $K_E$:
\begin{eqnarray}
    K_{E1} & \equiv & K_I ~ \frac{a}{b} \\
    K_{E2} & \equiv & K_I ~ \frac{1 + \frac{s}{K_S} + \frac{p}{K_P}}{1 + \frac{s}{aK_S} + \frac{P}{aK_P}}
\end{eqnarray}
and therefore that we rewrite the rate law from Eq. \ref{eq:gen_inh_model} as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\kappa &\equiv& \frac{1}{K_S \left(1 + \frac{s}{K_S} + \frac{p}{K_P}\right)} \nonumber \\
\gamma &\equiv& s - \frac{p}{K_{eq}} \nonumber \\
\theta &\equiv& \frac{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E1}}}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E2}}} \nonumber \\
v &=& V^+ \cdot \kappa \cdot \gamma \cdot \theta
\end{eqnarray}
The elasticity thus becomes:
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_x^v &=& 
	\frac{\frac{x}{K_{E1}}}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E1}}} ~-~ \frac{\frac{x}{K_{E2}}}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E2}}} = 
	\left( 1 - \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E1}}} \right) ~-~ \left(1 - \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E2}}} \right) \nonumber\\
	&=& -\left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E1}}} -  \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E2}}} \right) = 
	-\left( 1 -  \frac{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E1}}}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E2}}} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E1}}} \nonumber\\
	&=& -(1 - \theta) \cdot  \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{K_{E1}}}
\end{eqnarray}
and after replacing $K_{E1}$ back with its definition:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\epsilon_x^v = -\left(1 - \theta\right) \cdot  \left( 1 + b \frac{x}{aK_I} \right)^{-1}
\end{eqnarray}

As expected, in all cases of complete inhibition ($b = 0$), we reach exactly the same conclusion as in the extreme cases, namely:
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_x^v = -(1 - \theta) \label{eq:eps_general_inh}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{The Monod-Changeux-Jacob model}
Probably the most widespread model for cooperativity of substrate and effector binding was proposed by \citet{Monod1965-dq}. In this model the rate law is given by the following formula:
\begin{eqnarray}
v &=& V^+ \cdot \frac{s}{K_M + s} \cdot \frac{\left(1 + \frac{s}{K_M}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{a}{K_A}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{x}{K_I}\right)^{-h}}{L + \left(1 + \frac{s}{K_M}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{a}{K_A}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{x}{K_I}\right)^{-h}}
\end{eqnarray}
where $a$ is the concentration of an inhibitor, and $K_M$, $K_A$ and $K_I$ are the dissociation constants for the active form of the enzyme (for $s$, $a$ and $x$ respectively), $n$ is the number of subunits, and $L$ is the allosteric constant. As before, we can define the saturation term $\kappa$ and the relative activity term $\theta$ (i.e. the decrease from maximal activity):
\begin{eqnarray}
\kappa &\equiv& \frac{s}{K_M + s} \nonumber\\
\theta &\equiv& \frac{\left(1 + \frac{s}{K_M}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{a}{K_A}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{x}{K_I}\right)^{-h}}{L + \left(1 + \frac{s}{K_M}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{a}{K_A}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{x}{K_I}\right)^{-h}} \nonumber\\
v &=& V^+ \cdot \kappa \cdot \theta
\end{eqnarray}
To simplify the form of the equations, let 
\begin{equation}
g(x) \equiv \left(1 + \frac{s}{K_M}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{a}{K_A}\right)^h \left(1 + \frac{x}{K_I}\right)^{-h}
\end{equation}

\noindent so that $\theta = \frac{g(x)}{L + g(x)}$, which we write in shorthand as $\theta= \frac{g}{L+g}$. Then, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_x^v = V^+ \cdot \kappa \cdot \frac{\partial\theta}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{x}{v} 
= V^+ \cdot \kappa \cdot \frac{L}{(L+g)^2} \cdot \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{x}{v}
\end{eqnarray}

Now, we can calculate that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = \frac{-h}{K_I + x} \cdot g
\end{equation}

Substituting this form of $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}$ into the prior equation, we arrive at 
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_x^v = V^+ \cdot \kappa \cdot \frac{g}{L + g} \cdot \frac{-hx}{K_I + x} \cdot \frac{L}{L + g} \cdot \frac{1}{v}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Note that the first three terms are precisely equal to $v$, so they cancel with the last term. Also note that $\frac{L}{L + g} = 1 - \frac{g}{L + g} = 1 - \theta$. Thus, we arrive at

\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_x^v = \frac{\partial \ln{v}}{\partial \ln{x}} = \frac{\partial \ln{\theta}}{\partial \ln{x}} = -h~\frac{x}{K_I + x} ~\left(1 - \theta \right)\,.
\end{eqnarray}

In \cite{Heinrich1974-yj}, the elasticity of the inhibitor was calculated for this rate law (denoted as \emph{effector strength} or $X_I$ in the original text) and matches the form above.
Although the final formulae for the elasticities in the MWC case are not identical to the other cases dealt with before, we can still reach a similar conclusion, where the absolute value of the elasticity is larger when the relative activity is smaller.

\subsection{A Trade-off between Enzyme Cost and Flux Control}
By taking the absolute value of the elasticity, we can compress the results for activators (Equation \ref{eq:eps_act}) and inhibitors (Equations \ref{eq:eps_inh}, \ref{eq:eps_comp_inh}, \ref{eq:eps_uncomp_inh}, and \ref{eq:eps_general_inh}, excluding the MWC model) into one formula:
\begin{eqnarray}
|\epsilon_x^v| = h (1 - \theta)~. \label{eq:abs_elast}
\end{eqnarray}
This relationship can be visualized in the following plot (for different values of $h$):
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
	\begin{axis}[width=200pt,axis x line=bottom, axis y line=left, tick align=outside, domain=0:1, xlabel=$\theta$ (relative activity), ylabel=$|\epsilon_x^v|$ (absolute elasticity)]
		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{1 * (1 - \x)});
		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{2 * (1 - \x)});
		\addplot+[mark=none,smooth] (\x,{3 * (1 - \x)});
	\end{axis}
	\node[rotate=-15] at (1.2, 1.4) {h = 1};
	\node[rotate=-29] at (1.2, 2.6) {h = 2};
	\node[rotate=-40] at (1.2, 3.8) {h = 3};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Since $\theta$ represents the fraction of active enzyme, we see here that there is direct trade-off between the activity of the enzyme and the elasticity. It should be noted, that evolution can easily adjust $\theta$ for an individual enzyme by changing the $K_A$ or $K_I$ values, even without changing the concentration of the small-molecule effector (assuming it has other crucial functions in the cell). Therefore, evolution needs to weigh between how much of the enzyme is "wasted" by inhibition (or by inactivation), versus how much control it has on the flux. This can be viewed as a trade-off between the short-term goal of being able to adjust things quickly and the long-term goal of allocating resources efficiently in order to grow as fast as possible.

Another corollary of Equation \ref{eq:abs_elast} is that the control can be increased by changing the Hill coefficient ($h$). This could be a reason why mechanisms with very high cooperativity evolve for allosteric regulation \cite{Monod1965-dq}, as it increases elasticity without the added cost of losing enzyme activity.
