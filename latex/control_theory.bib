  abstract = "Michaelis and Menten's mechanism for enzymatic catalysis is
              remarkable both in its simplicity and its wide applicability. The
              extension for reversible processes, as done by Haldane, makes it
              even more relevant as most enzymes catalyze reactions that are
              reversible in nature and carry in vivo flux in both directions.
              Here, we decompose the reversible Michaelis-Menten equation into
              three terms, each with a clear physical meaning: catalytic
              capacity, substrate saturation and thermodynamic driving force.
              This decomposition facilitates a better understanding of enzyme
              kinetics and highlights the relationship between thermodynamics
              and kinetics, a relationship which is often neglected. We further
              demonstrate how our separable rate law can be understood from
              different points of view, shedding light on factors shaping
              enzyme catalysis.",
