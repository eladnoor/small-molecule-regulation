  abstract = "Michaelis and Menten's mechanism for enzymatic catalysis is
              remarkable both in its simplicity and its wide applicability. The
              extension for reversible processes, as done by Haldane, makes it
              even more relevant as most enzymes catalyze reactions that are
              reversible in nature and carry in vivo flux in both directions.
              Here, we decompose the reversible Michaelis-Menten equation into
              three terms, each with a clear physical meaning: catalytic
              capacity, substrate saturation and thermodynamic driving force.
              This decomposition facilitates a better understanding of enzyme
              kinetics and highlights the relationship between thermodynamics
              and kinetics, a relationship which is often neglected. We further
              demonstrate how our separable rate law can be understood from
              different points of view, shedding light on factors shaping
              enzyme catalysis.",

               classroom textbook that describes the various rate laws one can
               use to build computer models of cellular networks. The book
               covers commonly addressed topics such as rapid-equilibrium and

               activators, cooperatively and allostery. The text book also
               includes topics more relevant to systems biology; these include
               chapters on elasticities, generalized rate laws and kinetics
               laws used to describe gene expression. Exercises are provided in
               most chapters with a summary of all the major kinetic rate laws

	systematically turning metabolic networks into kinetic models.
	They should provide simple, general and biochemically
	plausible formulae for reaction velocities and reaction
	elasticities. At the same time, they need to respect
	thermodynamic relations between the kinetic constants and the
	metabolic fluxes and concentrations. RESULTS: We present a
	family of reversible rate laws for reactions with arbitrary
	stoichiometries and various types of regulation, including
	mass-action, Michaelis-Menten and uni-uni reversible Hill
	kinetics as special cases. With a thermodynamically safe
	parameterization of these rate laws, parameter sets obtained
	by model fitting, sampling or optimization are guaranteed to
	lead to consistent chemical equilibrium states. A
	reformulation using saturation values yields simple formulae
	for rates and elasticities, which can be easily adjusted to
	the given stationary flux distributions. Furthermore, this
	formulation highlights the role of chemical potential
	differences as thermodynamic driving forces. We compare the
	modular rate laws to the thermodynamic-kinetic modelling
	formalism and discuss a simplified rate law in which the
	reaction rate directly depends on the reaction affinity. For
	automatic handling of modular rate laws, we propose a standard

	(COBRA) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of
	metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to
	the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort
	to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated
	models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is
	a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of
	metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture
	the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and
	lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in
	systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort
	to promote constraints-based research through the distribution
	of freely available software. RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA
	for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support
	for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an
	object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of
	the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene
	expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
	however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for
	MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved
	performance, COBRApy includes parallel processing support for
	computationally intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an
	object-oriented framework designed to meet the computational
	challenges associated with the next generation of
	stoichiometric constraint-based models and high-density omics
	data sets. AVAILABILITY: http://opencobra.sourceforge.net/",
