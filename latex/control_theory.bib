  abstract = "Michaelis and Menten's mechanism for enzymatic catalysis is
              remarkable both in its simplicity and its wide applicability. The
              extension for reversible processes, as done by Haldane, makes it
              even more relevant as most enzymes catalyze reactions that are
              reversible in nature and carry in vivo flux in both directions.
              Here, we decompose the reversible Michaelis-Menten equation into
              three terms, each with a clear physical meaning: catalytic
              capacity, substrate saturation and thermodynamic driving force.
              This decomposition facilitates a better understanding of enzyme
              kinetics and highlights the relationship between thermodynamics
              and kinetics, a relationship which is often neglected. We further
              demonstrate how our separable rate law can be understood from
              different points of view, shedding light on factors shaping
              enzyme catalysis.",

               therefore been reduced in price by 20\%. Enzyme Kinetics for
               System Biology is geared towards those who need a reference or
               classroom textbook that describes the various rate laws one can
               use to build computer models of cellular networks. The book
               covers commonly addressed topics such as rapid-equilibrium and
               steady state kinetics, including chapters on inhibitors,
               activators, cooperatively and allostery. The text book also
               includes topics more relevant to systems biology; these include
               chapters on elasticities, generalized rate laws and kinetics
               laws used to describe gene expression. Exercises are provided in
               most chapters with a summary of all the major kinetic rate laws
               in an appendix. Chapters include: Reaction Kinetics Elasticities
               Basic Enzyme Kinetics Enzyme Inhibition and Activation

	systematically turning metabolic networks into kinetic models.
	They should provide simple, general and biochemically
	plausible formulae for reaction velocities and reaction
	elasticities. At the same time, they need to respect
	thermodynamic relations between the kinetic constants and the
	metabolic fluxes and concentrations. RESULTS: We present a
	family of reversible rate laws for reactions with arbitrary
	stoichiometries and various types of regulation, including
	mass-action, Michaelis-Menten and uni-uni reversible Hill
	kinetics as special cases. With a thermodynamically safe
	parameterization of these rate laws, parameter sets obtained
	by model fitting, sampling or optimization are guaranteed to
	lead to consistent chemical equilibrium states. A
	reformulation using saturation values yields simple formulae
	for rates and elasticities, which can be easily adjusted to
	the given stationary flux distributions. Furthermore, this
	formulation highlights the role of chemical potential
	differences as thermodynamic driving forces. We compare the
	modular rate laws to the thermodynamic-kinetic modelling
	formalism and discuss a simplified rate law in which the
	reaction rate directly depends on the reaction affinity. For
	automatic handling of modular rate laws, we propose a standard
	syntax and semantic annotations for the Systems Biology Markup
	Language. AVAILABILITY: An online tool for inserting the rate
	laws into SBML models is freely available at
